Movie Summary:
==============
There are two types of movies for visualizing simulations:
1. full_sim_movie - to create a movie of a static simulation, showing the nucleosomes over time during the simulation.
2. nuc_dynamics_movie - to create a movie of a dynamic simulation. The function accepts the nuc_history of a dynamic simulation and makes a movie that shows the nucleosome distribution and how it changes over time, while the experimental data from 0 minutes and 2 hours is displayed so we can see how the nucleosome distribution gradually moves from the initial state to the final state.

Documentation for each funtion is within the function itself, and movies for example are saved in the "movies" folder.
